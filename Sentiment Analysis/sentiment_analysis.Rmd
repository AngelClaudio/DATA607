# Introduction 

We will be using the work from chapter 2 of:

* **Text Mining with R**  _by Julia Silge & David Robinson_.

![](https://www.tidytextmining.com/images/cover.png){ width=40% }

The task is to:

1. Recreate a primary example of chapter 2, we will look at word cloud comparison.

2. Extend the code in two ways
    * Find a different corpus
    * Incorporate at least one additional sentiment lexicon (possibly from another R package through research)

# Recreate Chapter 2 Example {.tabset}

## Library Setup

1. **DT** is merely for presentation purposes
2. **janeaustenr** is to use the example data
3. **reshape2** for turning a data frame into a matrix
4. **tidyverse** mostly for data munging tasks
5. **tidytext** for leveraging unnest functionality
6. **wordcloud** is for creating the word cloud visualizations


```{r r-setup, message=F}
library(DT)
library(janeaustenr)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)
```

## Data Munging

1. Take the austen books data-set, and start by grouping by books
2. Add columns line number and chapter
3. Ungroup and use the **unnest_tokens** function to get all the unigrams

```{r r-example}
tidy_books <- austen_books() %>% group_by(book) %>%
    mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
           chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, 
                                       regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                       ignore_case = T)))) %>%
    ungroup() %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)

datatable(filter(tidy_books, book == "Pride & Prejudice" & chapter == 5))
```

## Word Cloud Data Analysis

We can see here that the size of the word is indicative of it's frequency in comparison to others within it's sentiment.

```{r r-analysis, message= F}
tidy_books %>% inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
            count(word, sentiment, sort = T) %>%
            acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
            comparison.cloud(colors = c("gray20", "gray80"), max.words = 100)
```


# Using a different Corpus

1. load the library for the **gutenbergr** project
2. leverage function **gutenber_download** by passing the ID of the book (IDs can be discerned from **gutenberg_works** function)
3. tidy up the data, and get ready to dive into **_Alice in Wonderland_**

```{r message = F}
library(gutenbergr)

alice_in_wonderland <- gutenberg_download(11) %>% mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
           chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, 
                                       regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                       ignore_case = T)))) %>%
           unnest_tokens(word, text)
```


# Incorporate Additional Sentiment {.tabset}

## Alice in Wonderland Emotional Analysis

1. load up the **lexicon** library
2. I found the **nrc_emotions** lexicon interesting since it dealt with 8 simple emotions
3. I thought it would be interesting to use those emotions from the lexicon as descriptors, so I had to leverage **pivot_longer** function to get them into one column for the **wordcloud** function.

```{r}
library(lexicon)

alice_in_wonderland %>% inner_join(nrc_emotions, by = c("word" = "term")) %>%
    select(-gutenberg_id, -linenumber,-chapter, -word) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "word") %>%
    filter(value != 0) %>%
    select(word) %>% count(word) %>% 
    with(wordcloud(word, n, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))) 

```

## Moby Dick Emotional Analysis

I wanted to then analyze a book that was intended for a more mature audience for comparison, my choice was **_Moby Dick_** since I feel it's a stark contrast to the much more playful **_Alice in Wonderland_**.

```{r}

moby_dick <- gutenberg_download(15) %>% mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
           chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, 
                                       regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                       ignore_case = T)))) %>%
           unnest_tokens(word, text)

moby_dick %>% inner_join(nrc_emotions, by = c("word" = "term")) %>%
    select(-gutenberg_id, -linenumber,-chapter, -word) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "word") %>%
    filter(value != 0) %>%
    select(word) %>% count(word) %>% 
    with(wordcloud(word, n, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))) 

```


# Conclusion

It was fun to see that _Alice in Wonderland_, being a child's book, was slated as invoking emotions of anticipation, trust, and joy. _Moby Dick_ being a book intended for a more mature audience seemed to be high on anticipation, trust, fear, and sadness. I believe the emotion of anticipation was consistent in both books since in general authors will try to keep their audience engaged. I think emotions may be good predictors for classifying reading material.
